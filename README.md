# SERP-Scraper-SOV-Visualizer
Early-stage experiment in dissecting a Google SERP, scraping and parsing it down to its most atomic elements and graphing out insights drawn from that process.
This is using an old version of [NikolaiT](https://github.com/NikolaiT)'s [GoogleScraper](https://github.com/NikolaiT/GoogleScraper), along with [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3)-based visualization code.
Note that the CSS selectors are probably woefully out of date. For usage instructions, let me refer you back to the [GoogleScraper](https://github.com/NikolaiT/GoogleScraper) page, and check the `D3` folder for the visualizations.
